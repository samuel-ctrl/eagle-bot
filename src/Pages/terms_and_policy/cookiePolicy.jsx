                  Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer
                  or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely
                  used by website owners in order to make their websites work,
                  or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting
                  information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Eagle Bot PTE
                  LTD) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties
                  other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies."
                  Third-party cookies enable third-party features or
                  functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g.,
                  advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties
                  that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer
                  both when it visits the website in question and also when it
                  visits certain other websites.

                <p>
                  We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons.
                  Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for
                  our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential"
                  or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us
                  to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
                  experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve
                  cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and
                  other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

                  You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject
                  cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your
                  preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent
                  Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you
                  accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they
                  are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification
                  banner and on our website. If you choose to reject cookies,
                  you may still use our website though your access to some
                  functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You

                  Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to
                  a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to
                  time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or
                  "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a
                  unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone
                  has visited our Website or opened an email including them.
                  This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns
                  of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver
                  or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have
                  come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on
                  a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to
                  measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many
                  instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to
                  function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their
                  functioning.

                    You have two options:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <u><strong>Add current sites</strong></u>: Select from available sites that are
                        currently open in a tab. Select the box to the left of
                        the site you want to add, and click Add. To go back,
                        select Cancel.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <u><strong>Add sites manually</strong></u>: Enter the web address and select

                The web address format for the manual site exclusion policy is:

              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some examples of how to add sites manually if you want
                to create an exclusion for:
              </p>
              <p>
                <u><b>Entire domains and subdomains</b></u>: Exclude the URL scheme. For
                example, eagle-bot.com matches and prevents deactivation of
                subdomains like platform.eagle-bot.com and canvas.eagle-bot.com.
              </p>

              <p>
                <ul>
                  <p>
                    <u><b>1. Specific domains, but not any subdomains</b></u>: Include a dot
                    (.) before the URL host. For example, .eagle-bot.com won't
                    match and prevent deactivation of subdomains like
                    www.eagle-bot.com, platform.eagle-bot.com, and
                    canvas.eagle-bot.com.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <u><b>2. Specific subdirectory</b></u>: Include the URL path. For example,
                    www.eagle-bot.com/contact matches and prevents deactivation
                    of all Eagle-bot Contact pages, but won't prevent
                    deactivation of the www.eagle-bot.com main pages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <u><b>3. URL host and query components</b></u>: Asterisks (*) can be used
                    as wildcards. For example, https:// matches and prevents
                    deactivation of all https sites and youtube.com/watch?v=*
                    matches and prevents deactivation of YouTube videos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <u><b>4. Wildcards for prefix</b></u>, suffix, or substring matches of the
                    URL host component aren't supported. For example,
                    <strong>eagle-bot.com or eagle-bot.com/</strong> won't match and prevent
                    deactivation.

                When Energy Saver is on, Eagle Browser reduces its image capture
                rate and other background tasks to help conserve your device's
                battery. It works automatically whenever your device is
                unplugged, or when your battery is low. Please note that Energy
                Saver doesn't turn on when your device is plugged in.

                To extend your device's battery life for a long road trip or
                plane ride, we recommend turning on Energy Saver. However, when
                Energy Saver is on, you may notice changes in gaming and video
                performance. Energy Saver is available on Windows, Mac, and
                ChromeOS devices with a battery installed.

                  The information provided when using the Services is not
                  intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in
                  any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use
                  would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject
                  us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or
                  country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the
                  Services from other locations do so on their own initiative
                  and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if
                  and to the extent local laws are applicable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific
                  regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
                  Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act
                  (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to
                  such laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use the
                  Services in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
                  Act (GLBA).

                  person/entity being reviewed;
                </p>
                <p>
                  (2) your reviews should not contain offensive profanity, or

                    with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or
                    authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action
                    basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
                    is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
                    purported representative capacity on behalf of the general
                    public or any other persons.

                  <h4>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h4>
                  <p>
                    The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not
                    subject to the above provisions concerning informal
                    negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking
                    to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of
                    the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute
                    related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
                    invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim
                    for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
                    illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
                    arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
                    provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such
                    Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
                    jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
                    above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
                    jurisdiction of that court.

                  These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted
                  by us on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute
                  the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our
                  failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
                  Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
                  provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent
                  permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and
                  obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible
                  or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act
                  caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any
                  provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is
                  determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
                  provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from
                  these Legal Terms and does not affect the validity and
                  enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
                  venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship
                  created between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or
                  use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not
                  be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You
                  hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the
                  electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing
                  by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.

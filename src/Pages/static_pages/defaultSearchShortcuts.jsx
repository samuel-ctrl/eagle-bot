                In Eagle Browser, the address bar (omnibox) can also serve as a
                search box. By default, it uses a search engine that you can

              <p>
                <strong>To avoid malware in the future</strong>, you can take
                the following precautions:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Beware of websites that may prompt you to download unwanted
                software or files. For instance, avoid downloading files that
                offer copyrighted content for free or winning contests that
                require you to download software.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Be cautious of encrypted archives such as .zip files that
                require a password. These archives may bypass antivirus
                detection scans and contain malicious software.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Avoid warnings about viruses or infected devices,
                particularly if you havenâ€™t recently used a virus scanner.
                Scammers may use these warnings to trick you into downloading
                malicious software.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. Avoid insecure connections when visiting websites and do not
                download files from sites that do not start with HTTPS. Learn
                how to check if a website's connection is secure.
              </p>
              <p>
                5. Pay attention to Safe Browsing download warnings. Malicious
                actors may ask you to ignore or turn off warnings to avoid
                antivirus detections.
              </p>
              <p>
                6. If a popup about a program update or download seems
                suspicious, do not click on it. Instead, go to the program's
                official website to download it.
              </p>
              <p>
                By following these steps, you can reduce the risk of malware
                infecting your computer or device in the future.

                  Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act
                  (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to
                  such laws, you may not use the Services.

                <p>
                  You may not use the Services in a way that would violate the

                  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
                  submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator
                  will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
                  statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The
                  arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be
                  challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where
                  otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable
                  law, the arbitration will take place in United States Of
                  America, California.

                  on the award entered by the arbitrator. If for any reason, a
                  Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute
                  shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal
                  courts located in INDIA and the Parties hereby consent to, and

                  permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any
                  other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any
                  Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize
                  class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or

                  The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject
                  to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a)
                  any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
                  validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a

                  allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
                  unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If
                  this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then

                  within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or

                  files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when
                  you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners
                  in order to make their websites work, or to work more
                  efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
                  Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Antimatterr
                  LLC) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties
                  other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies."
                  Third-party cookies enable third-party features or
                  functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g.,
                  advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties
                  that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer
                  both when it visits the website in question and also when it

                  <strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong> We use first- and
                  third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are
                  required for technical reasons in order for our Website to
                  operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly
                  necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and
                  target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on
                  our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our

                  <strong>How can I control cookies?</strong> You have the right
                  to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can
                  exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
                  Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you
                  to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject.
                  Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly
                  necessary to provide you with services. The Cookie Consent
                  Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our
                  website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use

                  Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to

                  time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or
                  "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a

                  collect and store information about your use of our services,
